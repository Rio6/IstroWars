      <h2>Stars</h2>
      The star names are from old server names, plus a bunch of auto generated names.
      They are connected to each other for players and factions to move.

      <h2>Factions</h2>
      The faction list is retrieved from <a href="https://istrostats.r26.me">IstroStats</a>.
      Each faction has an influence value on each star. The influence changes based on
      the games players in the star play. A faction expands into nearby star when
      its influence reaches 80%, but if it drops below 5%, it gets kicked from the star.

      <h2>Players</h2>
      Each day, a player can move to a nearby star. They can also change their faction
      tag in game at any time. Their location and faction determines the influence change
      of local factions when they play games.

      <h2>Influence</h2>
      When a game ends and all of these conditions are met:
      <ul>
         <li>The game mode is 1v1, 1v1r, 1v1t, 2v2, or 3v3</li>
         <li>There is a winning team</li>
         <li>All players on the winning team are in the same star</li>
      </ul>
      then the influence of each faction on the star would change.  For each
      faction in the star, their influence is increased by 1% for each player
      in the winning team who wears its tag. If there are no player in the
      winning team that wears its tag, the influence is deccreased by 1% instead.

      <h2>How to Join?</h2>
      Load the script <a href="/js/ui/mod.js" target="_blank">here</a> to
      access the IstroWars mode from the main menu. Alternatively, one can also
      use this code:
      <div class="code">
         onecup.script({src:"<span id="scripturl"></span>"})
      </div>
      to load the latest code automatically.
      <script>
         document.getElementById('scripturl').innerText = location.origin + '/js/ui/mod.js';
      </script>
      <div class="tip">

      </div>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      IstroWars is still in development, so far there is no anti-farming
      measures, and it's probably not balanced. There are ideas on adding AI
      combat to it but I still need to think about it. Contributions welcome on
      <a href="https://github.com/Rio6/IstroWars" target="_blank">Github</a>.
